# 01 - Computer Science, Data Science and Real Science

* Real scientists try to understand the real world, complicated and messy
* Computer scientists build their own clean and organized virtual world
* Scientists discover things, while computer scientists invent rather than discovering
<br><br>
* **Data vs Method Centrism:**
    * Scientists are data drive, while computer scientists are algorithm driven
* **Concern about results:**
    * Real scientists care about answers
    * Data scientists worry about performing quickly and efficiently
* **Robustness:**
    * Real scientists are comfortable with data having errors
    * They search for biases and problems in their conclusions from the data
* **Precision:**
    * Nothing is completely true or false in science
    * However, everything is either true or false in Computer Science and Mathematics
    * Computer Scientists care what a number is. Real scientists care what it means
<br><br>
* Aspiring data scientists have to learn to think like real scientists, turning numbers into insight
* **Why** is as important as **How**
* **Hypothesis driven science:**
    * Was based on asking quesition about the world and then generating data to confirm or deny it
* **Data-drive science:**
    * Focus on generating data in a giant scale, rendering new discoveries from looking at that imense dataset
<br><br>
* **Two important ways of thinking:**
    * Given a problem, what data helps answering it?
    * Given a dataset, what interesting problems can we apply it to?
<br><br>
* **Distinction between software engineering and data science:**
    * Software developers are hired to build systems
    * Data scientists are hired to produce insights
