# 03 - Properties of Data

* **Structured vs Unstructured Data:**
    * Structured data is represented by a **matrix**, where rows are items or records and columns are properties of those items
    * Unstructured data,for example, might be a collection of tweets
        * Thus we need to structure this data in a matrix
        * **Bag of words** model
            * A tweet in each row and a column for each frequently used vocabulary word

* **Quantitative vs Categorical Data:**
    * **Quantitative Data:**
        * Numerical values
        * Height, weight
        * Can be used directly in mathematical models or displayed in graphs
    * **Categorical Data:**
        * Describes properties of objects
        * Can be coded numerically
            * Gender 0 as male and 1 for female

* **Big Data vs Little Data:**
    * **Big Data**
        * Analysis of massive datasets
        * Challenges
            * Analysis cycle time slows as data size grows
            * Large data sets are complex to visualize
            * Simples models don't require massive data to fit
        * Any observation that is so subtle, requiring massive data will prove irrelevant to a large business based on volume
        * **Big data** is referred as **Bad Data**
            * Gathered as by-product of a system or procedure
            * Not purposefully collected to answer questions
        * The right dataset is the one most relevant to the tasks, not necessarily the biggest one
            * Seeking the right data to answer a given question is more important (and sometimes more adequated) than seeking the biggest dataset possible
