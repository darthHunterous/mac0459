# We Need Both Exploratory and Confirmatory Data Analysis

* **Introduction**
    * We forget how science and engineering works
        * Ideas comes from previous explorations more often than lightning strokes
    * Careful planning for confirmatory analysis
    * Finding the question is more important than finding the answer
    * Exploratory Data Analysis
        * Attitude
        * Flexibility
        * Reliance on display
        * Is not a bundle of techniques
    * Confirmatory Data Analysis
        * Easier to teach and computerize
<br><br>
* **Incomplete paradigm**
    * How science and engineering function
        * Question -> Design -> Collection -> Analysis -> Answer
    * Neglects crucial questions and their answers
        * How are questions generated?
            * Theoretical insights and exploration of past data
        * How are designs guided?
             * By the best qualitative and semiquantitative information available, obtained by exploration of past data
        * How is data collection monitored?
            * Exploring data as they come, for unexpected behavior
        * How to avoid analysis that data before indicated to be avoided?
            * By exploring data before, during and after analysis, for hints, ideas and some conclusions
    * **Confirmatory Paradigm**
        * Idea -> (Loop between Question and Design) -> Collection -> Analysis -> Answer
        * Obtained through both confirmatory and exploratory analysis
        * Example
            * Idea of a certain drug helping in a certain disease
            * "Of those who would die within three years from this disease, what fraction could be save with this drug?"
                * No known Design would be able to isolate these people for experimentation
            * It is better to formulate a question limited by constraints as:
                * Age and sex of patients
                * Minimum set of symptoms
                * Absence of other diseases
                * Type of patients
            * The above formulation of the question involves what can be asked, what designs are feasible and also, how a design can give an useful answer
    * **Science doesn't begin with a tidy question and doesn't end with a tidy answer**
<br><br>
* **Important Questions**
    * A question that **MUST** be answered and we must be **CERTAIN** of the answer
        * Necessary resources of money, skll and data management
        * Preplanning the main analysis
        * Solid confirmatory analysis are based in randomization theory
        * Multiplicity of statically independent analyses might be a problem, leading to concluding less about the question
            * Confirmatory studies are optimal having a single main question, specified by **ALL** of design, collection, monitoring and **ANALYSIS**
* **The Broad General Inquiry**
    * What do we suppose goes on in that general area?
        * What can easily be tried?
        * How to study what is going on out there now?
* **A Maxim**
    * Finding the question is often more important than finding the answer
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**
    * It is
        * Attitude
        * Flexibility
        * Graph Paper
    * Techniques can't convey a willingness to look for what can be seen or anticipated
    * The graph paper represented here is not present as a technique, instead as a recognition of the picture-examining eye as the finder of unanticipated discoveries
* **Confirmatory Data Analysis**
    * Easy to teach routine
    * A routine easy to computerize
<br><br>
* **Conclusions**
    * We need to teach both confirmatory and exploratory data analyses
    * We need to think about science and engineering more broadly than the narrow paradigm of question to answer
    * To do confirmation on important questions we need to be very caregul about randomizing and avoiding multiplicity
    * We need to teach exploratory as an attitude, as well as some helpful techniques, probably before teaching confirmatory
